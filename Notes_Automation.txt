Data base Prompts:
Fuck me. I have changed the databases for reference lists so that needs to be updated, but this probably for the better I need something that works with many refrence sentences and it needs to be tested that is fine.The only thing I worry about is that the schema is slightly off, but it is what is. I can figure it out when/if it becomes a problem



VOCABULARY Database trascription:

I need these vocabulary words from this textbook screenshot transcribed for my Supabase vocab table in CSV format. Enclose any definitions containing commas in double quotes and replace the commas within these fields with semicolons so that it causes no issues with CSV format, but keep the commas between columns. The table has these columns: 
id, unit_id, chinese_simplified, chinese_traditional, pinyin, english, and order_num. 

Important detials for this dataset
Module: #
Unit: ##
Vocabulary id will start with: ##X

Please follow these guidelines: 
**id:** Should start from (Module #)(unit  #)(Vocabulary 1) and increment for each new word. 
**unit_id:** Should be formatted as (module number)(unit number). For example, if it's module 6, unit 1, the unit_id would be 61. 
**chinese_simplified:** Translate the pinyin into simplified Chinese characters.
**chinese_traditional:** Translate the pinyin into traditional Chinese characters. 
**pinyin:** Transcribe the pinyin as it appears in the image, including any tone marks or special characters. 
**english:** Transcribe the English definition. If the definition contains commas, enclose the entire definition in double quotes. 
**order_num:** Should start at 1 and then move up incrementally

Here is an example of the CSV output format from module 6 unit 1 vocabulary 1: id,unit_id,chinese_simplified,chinese_traditional,pinyin,english,order_num

REFERENCE LIST Database transcription:

I need these dialogue references from this textbook screenshot transcribed for my Supabase `reference_list` table in CSV format. Enclose any definitions containing commas in double quotes and replace the commas within these fields with semicolons so that it causes no issues with CSV format, but keep the commas between columns. The table has these columns:
id, unit_id, number, chinese_simplified, chinese_traditional, pinyin, english, notes, order_num.

Important detials for this dataset
Module: #
unit_id: ##
id will start with: ##X

Please follow these guidelines:
**id:**  Generate a combined ID using the format (unit_id)(number). For example, if unit_id is 1 and reference number is 1, the id should be 11.  This ID is for your reference and does not need to be a database-generated ID.
**unit_id:** This is the unit identifier. Please provide the unit_id for the current screenshot. Assume this is a single integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
**number:** The reference number shown in the textbook.
**chinese_simplified:** Transcribe the complete dialogue in simplified characters, preserving all speaker labels (A:, B:) and line breaks.
**chinese_traditional:** Same for traditional characters.
**pinyin:** Transcribe the complete pinyin with tone marks, preserving speaker labels and line breaks.
**english:** Transcribe the complete English translation, preserving speaker labels and line breaks.
**notes:** Leave blank for now.
**order_num:** Same as the reference number.

Enclose all multi-line text fields in double quotes. Do not use Unicode escape sequences - use actual Chinese characters.

Example output (assuming unit_id = 1):
id,unit_id,number,chinese_simplified,chinese_traditional,pinyin,english,notes,order_num
11,1,1,"B：为
A：为，你是朱可彰吗？
B：是。您是内部人吗？

B: Yes. Who is this, please?

B: Oh, Mr. Martin—I haven't seen you for quite a while. How are you?",,1


Refrence List Notes transciption instuctions:
Transcribe this and make it easy to read and reference while keeping it close to the original. I will copy an paste this into a supabase database field.

NOTE: Some of these notes have tables which need to be transcribed in a consistant and elegant way for being shown in text
