B : Yes . Who is this , please ?
A : I'm William Martin .
B : Oh , Mr. Martin -- I haven't seen you for quite a while . How are you ?
A : Fine . How are you ?', 'Wéi is a greeting used in telephone conversations for "hello." Some speakers pronounce this greeting as wái. Unlike most Chinese words, wèi has no fixed tone. The intonation varies according to the speaker's mood.

Kēzhǎng: Kē means "section," and zhǎng means "head of an organization." Here are some examples of how -zhǎng, "chief," "head," is used:

kē         section
kēzhǎng   section chief

chù        division
chùzhǎng  division chief

xuéxiào   school
xiàozhǎng principal, headmaster

Nín shì něiwèi? Note the use of the polite terms nín and něiwèi. In the English translation, politeness is expressed by the use of the more indirect "Who is this" instead of "Who are you" and also by "please."

The preposition gēn, "with," differs from the conjunction gēn, "and," in two important ways: a) where stress may be placed b) where the negative may be placed.

(a) When gēn is used as the conjunction "and," both items being joined are stressed and keep their tones. When gēn is used as the prepositional verb "with," a pronoun which follows is unstressed and loses its tone. Notice the contrasting tones on tā in the following sentences:

Wǒ gēn tā dōu lái le.      Both he and I came.

Wǒ gēn ta lái.               I'll come with him.

(b) To make negative a sentence containing the conjunction gēn, "and," the negative is placed with the main verb. In sentences containing the prepositional verb gēn, "with," the negative precedes the prepositional verb. (You have seen this pattern with other prepositional verbs, for example, zài [see BIO, Unit 2, notes on Nos. 8-11.]). Notice the contrasting positions of the negatives in the examples below:

Wǒ gēn tā dōu méiyou qù.  Neither he nor I went.

Wǒ méiyou gēn ta qù.        I didn't go with him.

B : Yǒu gōngfu .', 'A : I don't know whether you have the time or not .
B : I have the time .', 'Gōngfu, "time," "free time," "leisure time," refers to a period of time during which a person is free, in the sense that his work may be interrupted.

Now you know three words for "time": shíhou, shíjiān, gōngfu Shihou may be used for either a point in time or an amount of time.

Nǐ shénme shíhou zǒu?      When are you leaving?

Zuò huǒchē yào zǒu duō-   How long does it take to go by train?

Shíjiān refers to any amount of time, including the time when a person is free.

Cóng zhèr dào fēijīchǎng  How long does it take from here to
yào duōshao shíjiān?      the airport?

Jīntiān méiyou shíjiān    There isn't time to go today.

B : Either today or tomorrow would be fine .', 'Duì, "to," "towards," "with regard to," "with respect to," is a prepositional verb which originally meant "facing." In modern Chinese, its object introduces either the target of the action or the thing concerned. Contrast this with gěi, "for": the object introduced by gěi receives the benefit of the action. These generalizations may help you sort out some of the differences between duì and gěi. You might find it helpful to memorize some examples, as well.

duì INTRODUCING THE TARGET OF THE ACTION ("to")

Nǐde huà shì duì shéi shuōde?    To whom were you speaking?
Tā duì wo hěn kèqi.          He is very polite to me.
Nǐ duì wo tài hǎo.          You are too good to me.

duì INTRODUCING THE THING CONCERNED ("with regard to," "with respect to")

Shénme shíhou duì nín héshì?    What time suits you?
Shénme shíhou duì nín fāngbian?  What time is convenient for you?

Notice that the English is "for you" in the last example, but in Chinese you must say "What time is convenient with regard to you?"

gěi INTRODUCING THE BENEFICIARY

Wǒ gěi tā xiěle xìn le.     I wrote him a letter.
Zhè shì yìzhāng shíkuàide,   Here's a ten-dollar bill. Please
qǐng nǐ gěi wo huànhuan.    change it for me.
Qǐng nǐ gěi wo xiě nǐde dìzhǐ. Would you write down your address
                            for me, please?

Héshì is an adjectival verb meaning "to fit," "to suit," "to be suitable/appropriate." When trying on clothes in a store, you might say Zhèige bù héshì, "This doesn't fit." In another situation, héshì could be translated very freely as "best": Něitiān duì nín héshì? "What day would be best for you?"', '4'), ('615', '61', '5', 'A : 今 天 下 午 两 点 钟 方 便 吗 ？

B : Three would be more convenient than two .', 'Sāndiǎn bǐ liǎngdiǎn fāngbian yīdiǎnr: Bǐ is a prepositional verb used to make comparisons between two things which are different. In translating, you may find it helpful to think of bǐ as the English "compared with" or "than." Notice that the bǐ phrase precedes the adjectival verb or another predicate in a sentence.

| Sāndiǎn    | bǐ                 | liǎngdiǎn   | fāngbian yīdiǎnr.    |

| (he) | than compared with | I    | have     | free time     |

"He has more free time than I do."

The two elements being compared may be nouns, pronouns, verb phrases, or even full sentences. Actually, all elements joined by bǐ act as nouns, as seen in the English translations of the examples below.
