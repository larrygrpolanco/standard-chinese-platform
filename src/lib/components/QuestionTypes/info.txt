Question Types
I recommend using these question types:
* multiple_choice - Questions with predefined options
* short_answer - Questions requiring text input
* table_row - Special questions that should be rendered as table rows
Handling Table Questions
For your rare table-based questions, I recommend this approach:
1. The first table question in a sequence gets marked as table_row
2. In the options field, store the column headers: "Person|Item|How Many"
3. The question_text can contain any row label if needed
Frontend code would detect a table_row type and render an appropriate table-based UI.
Example CSV Format
This format would be easy for both manual entry and

1,100,"How many times has Mr. ZhƒÅng moved?",multiple_choice,"Once|Twice",1
2,100,"How far is Section 2 from Section 1?",multiple_choice,"Very close|Very far|Not too far|Not too close",2
3,100,"What is the number of the lane in the first address?",short_answer,,3
4,101,"List the family members and items purchased",table_row,"Person|Item|How Many",1
5,101,"his wife",short_answer,,2
6,101,"his son",short_answer,,3


Frontend Implementation
The frontend can handle this structure with a simple switch statement:
javascript
Copy
function renderQuestion(question) {
  switch(question.question_type) {
    case 'multiple_choice':
      return renderMultipleChoice(question);
    case 'short_answer':
      return renderShortAnswer(question);
    case 'table_row':
      return renderTableQuestion(question, followingQuestions);
    default:
      return renderDefault(question);
  }
}
